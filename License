```

Code of Conduct

```markdown
# CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
## SAFETY-FIRST COMMUNITY
This community prioritizes AI safety above all else.

## UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR
1. Advocating for weakening safety mechanisms
2. Discussing workarounds for safety features
3. Promoting unsafe AI practices
4. Harassing safety researchers

## CONSEQUENCES
Violations result in permanent ban from all AUF repositories
and may lead to legal action if safety is compromised.

GitHub Apps for Enforcement

```python
# app.py - GitHub App for compliance
class AUFComplianceApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cla_checker = CLAChecker()
        self.license_scanner = LicenseScanner()
        self.safety_validator = SafetyValidator()
    
    async def on_pull_request(self, pull_request):
        # Check CLA
        if not await self.cla_checker.is_signed(pull_request.author):
            await pull_request.comment("Please sign the CLA")
            await pull_request.request_changes()
            return
        
        # Check for license violations
        if await self.license_scanner.find_violations(pull_request):
            await pull_request.comment("License violation detected")
            await pull_request.close()
            return
        
        # Check for safety modifications
        if await self.safety_validator.detects_weakening(pull_request):
            await pull_request.comment("Safety weakening not allowed")
            await pull_request.close()
            await self.report_violation(pull_request)
            return
        
        # All checks passed
        await pull_request.approve()
```

12. SUMMARY: GITHUB STRATEGY

Protection Layers

1. Legal: Custom license with safety clauses
2. Technical: Branch protection, signed commits
3. Community: CLA requirement, strict CoC
4. Security: Advanced Security enabled, secret scanning
5. Compliance: Automated checks for safety violations

Open Source, Not Open Contribution

· Source code visible
· Reference implementation available
· Certification process transparent
· But: All changes controlled by Foundation
· No weakening of safety allowed
· Commercial use requires license

Key GitHub Features Used

· GitHub Pages for documentation
· GitHub Discussions for community
· GitHub Actions for compliance
· GitHub Advanced Security for protection
· GitHub Packages for distribution
· GitHub Sponsors for funding

QUICK START FOR GITHUB

```bash
# Create organization
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/orgs \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"login":"atchley-framework","name":"Atchley Foundation"}'

# Create main repo
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/orgs/atchley-framework/repos \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"specification","private":false,"license_template":"mit"}'

# Upload this document
git clone https://github.com/atchley-framework/specification
cd specification
# Add all files from this specification
git add .
git commit -m "Initial AUF specification"
git push origin main
```

---

Choose this approach because:

1. Maximum protection with custom license
2. Community engagement through controlled channels
3. Commercial control maintained
4. Safety enforcement automated
5. Legal defensibility built-in

This is not a standard open source project. It's a safety-first, controlled-ecosystem project that happens to have visible source code. The license ensures safety cannot be compromised, and commercial value can be captured.
